# RecentChangesLogFilter

*RecentChangesLogFilter* is a [MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org) extension to filter log entries displayed in *Special:RecentChanges*. It was primarily created to be able to hide all *user creation* log entries from recent changes in case the wiki is targetted by a spam bot network where many accounts are created.
